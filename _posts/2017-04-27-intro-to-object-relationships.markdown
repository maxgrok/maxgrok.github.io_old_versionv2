So far, I've gone through over half of the Object-Oriented Ruby lesson track. However, I got stuck on Object Relationships and took a break from studying. I've recently gotten unstuck. So, that's what we will go over today: object relationships.  

<h2>Intro to Object Relationships</h2>

Everything in programming serves to model a real-world situation. These real-world situatiosn are translated into the domain model. The domain model is made up of objects such as Classes. 

For example, users in a social networking applicaiton end up being associated with each other based on friendships. 

Another example that is used on the Flatiron curriculum is in music. For example, one song belongs to an artist, while an artist may have many songs, a song may only have one artist for the purpose of this example atleast.

This leads us to the first relationship between objects that we will explore.  

<h2>"Belongs To" Relationship</h2>

One song belongs to one artist in this continued example. How do we represent this in code? 

```
	Class Song
		attr_accessor :title, :artist

		def initialize(title)
			@title = title
		end
	end
	Class Artist
		attr_accessor :name, :genre

		def initialize(name, genre)
			@name = name
			@genre = genre
		end
	end
```
Great! Now we can explore that relationship. 

``` michael_ray = Artist.new("Michael Ray", "Country")
	kiss_you_in_the_morning = Song.new("Kiss You In The Morning")
	kiss_you_in_the_morning.artist = michael_ray```

So, if we try to find out the artist genre or name, we can simply use the song name like this: 

``` kiss_you_in_the_morning.artist.genre #=> "Country"
kiss_you_in_the_morning.artist.name #=> "Michael Ray"```

To quote the Flatiron curriculum, "a song can only have one artist (atleast in our domain model), so we say that a song "belongs to" an artist." 

So, what if we want to represent the relationship that Artist have in the real-world to songs? What can we use in code to represent an artist having many different songs? 

<h2>"Has Many" Relationship</h2>

The answer is to use the inverse of the "belongs to" relationship, the "has many" relationship. 

This means that the artist has many songs. How do we represent this in code? 

``` 
	Class Artist
		attr_accessor :name

		def initialize(name)
			@name = name
			@songs = []
		end

		def songs 
			@songs
		end

		def add_songs(song)
			@songs << song
		end
	end
	Class Song
		attr_accessor :title, :artist

		def initialize(title)
			@title = title
		end
	end 
``` 

First we initialize with an empty collection of songs. Second, we make a instance method called "add_songs" to add songs to our instance variable array @songs. Third, we need a way to view our songs, so we make a instance method called songs, which only displays our songs for that specific artist. This is who we represent the "has many" relationship in code. 

This is a basic introduction to object relationships.
